This file is meant to be kept as notes on conditions of experiment that are vital to calculations.
Record the filename range of numbers output by the XMAP.
Record which channels were used (0-3), which was shorter, and the difference in optical lengths in meters.
The value range of 22keV could also be kept here.

Example:
day1_run5, 0-7: channels 0 and 1 used, 0 was shorter by 0.10 meters
